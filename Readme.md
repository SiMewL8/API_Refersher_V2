# API Refresher Course

This is a notes document for [API Beginner Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/apis-for-beginners/) on freeCodeCamp. Utilizing Twilio REST API to send/receive text messages from applications such as:

- Command Line Interface (CMD) with curl and HTTPS URL encoding
- RestFox browser REST API client
- Visual Studio Code with Thunder REST API client
- Small Project with Serverless/Server-Side API client

Planning to upload this to GitHub as a refresher project. Willing to start, and starting small is always a good first step. The purpose for this project is to get up to speed with various tech stacks for project management/version control via Git/GitHub and utilizing the world of remote Web-based APIs.

Tasks
- figure out why fetch is not working for my json file
- follow along API tutorial using JavaScript, and learn about asynchronous usage as I go
- project with TWILIO Rest API using JavaScript
